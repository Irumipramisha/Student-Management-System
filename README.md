A robust, console-based Java application designed to manage student records efficiently. This project demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and persistent data storage in Java.

## Key Features
- **Add Records:** Easily input student details including Name, unique ID, and GPA.
- **View Records:** Display all stored student information in a formatted list.
- **Data Persistence:** Uses **File I/O** to save data into a `students.txt` file, ensuring data is not lost when the program exits.
- **Input Validation:** Handles potential errors during data entry using `try-catch` blocks and input buffer clearing.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java (JDK 22+)
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
- **Data Structures:** ArrayList for dynamic memory management.
- **Persistence:** Java File Handling (`FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `PrintWriter`).

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the source files.
3. Open the project in an IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse).
4. Run the `Main.java` file.
5. Follow the on-screen menu instructions in the terminal.

## File Structure
- `Main.java`: Contains the main logic, menu system, and file handling methods.
- `Student.java`: The model class defining student attributes and methods.
- `students.txt`: The text file where student data is persistently stored.
